_Our companies feast at the Open Source table year after year. [Let's settle up][osp]._

Our goal is to establish a new social norm in the tech industry of companies paying Open Source maintainers — a minimum
of $2000 per year per developer on staff at our companies, to Open Source maintainers of each company’s choosing. This
is in addition to the code, developer time, and gifts-in-kind that many of our companies also contribute.
