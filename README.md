_Open Source software powers the world, but who supports the maintainers? [We do][osp]._

Our goal is to establish a new social norm in the tech industry of companies paying Open Source maintainers — a minimum
of $2000 per year per developer on staff, to Open Source maintainers of each company’s choosing. This is in addition to
the code, developer time, and gifts-in-kind that many Pledge member companies also contribute.
