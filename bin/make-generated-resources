# HACK: This momentarily installs fonts into the user's font folder, then
# removes them (unless they already existed).
#
# We would like to have imagemagick generate images using fonts that we
# explicitly specify by path. This would allow us to avoid polluting default
# font directories such as the user's `~/.local/share/fonts` directory. But
# there doesn't seem a way to explicitly give imagemagick font paths, outside
# of the `-font` option, which is not consulted when converting SVG text to
# PNG. imagemagick uses fontconfig to get the list of installed fonts, but
# there doesn't seem to be a way to momentarily get fontconfig to use a font,
# and indeed this might not make sense.
#
# So, for each font file:
# * put it in the user's font directory unless it's already there,
# * do our imagemagick stuff,
# * if the file is less than one hour old, remove it.
